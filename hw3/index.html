<h3>Storyboard</h3>
<div class="image-container"><img src="BallStoryboard-1.png" width="768"></div>
<p>Note how in the final animation, the plunger has been replaced with a hammer. This is due to me not finding any good plunger models (most were of toilet plungers), so I switched to a hammer instead. I was inspired to add in a cannonball due to last year's projects and to try my hand at squashing the ball really flat. The bouncy ball getting squashes was inspired by Luxo Jr, although obviously a cannonball is cooler than a lamp.</p>

<h3>Principles</h3>
<div>
  <div>
    <h5>Squash and Stretch</h5>
    <p>The bouncy ball squashes in response to being hit by the hammer, bouncing, and being crushed by the cannonball. It stretches as it gets to the top of its arcs.</p>

  <div>
    <h5>Anticipation</h5>
    <p>The hammer pulls back before swinging to hit the ball.</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <h5>Follow-Through</h5>
    <p>The hammer continues to rotate after hitting the ball.</p>

  <div>
    <h5>Arcs</h5>
    <p>The bouncy ball travels in arcs as it bounces down the steps and across the floor. The hammer rotates through an arc as it swings.</p>

<p>Note how the squash and stretch applies not only to the bounces, but also as a reaction to getting hit by the hammer.</p>

<h3>Other Comments</h3>
<p>Rendered with Maya's Software Renderer. The sky background was inspired by me listening to Led Zeppelin's "Stairway To Heaven". The texture was called a marble texture, but it is darker than marble so I would personally consider it more of a diabase. The song is one I didn't hear until a few weeks ago when I heard it on my Spotify disocvery playlist. I instantly knew it was the perfect sng for this project.</p>
