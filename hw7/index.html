<h3>Storyboard and Design</h3>
<div>
  <div class="image-container"><img src="storyboard.png" width="768"></div>
  <p>I am a big aviation fan so I wanted to incorporate planes into my animation and thus came up with this little ditty. The flying and landing of the plane is simple to express yet also is able to bring a fair number of the principles of animation. It was also pretty fun to make. I decided to go with two scenes so that I could give a sense of the first scene taking place higher up while the second is close to and on the ground.</p>

<h3>Other Comments</h3>
<p>Rendered with Maya's Software Renderer.</p>
<p>For this project, I used the raycasting provided by Maya's Software renderer for the first time. This gives the body of the plane some nice reflections of the wings while also provided the shadow on landing that helps inform the viewer that the plane is getting closer to the runway.</p>
