  <h3>Additions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Changed the spacing of the planets so that the gas giants are farther from the terrestrial planets, and Pluto is even farther.</p></li>
    <li><p>Created equatorial bulges for Earth through Neptune by increasing the x and z-axis scales while reducing the y-axis scales.</p></li>
    <li><p>Animated the sun and planets so that they "squish" up and down by keyframing the y-axis scale..</p></li>
    <li><p>Tilted Pluto's orbit in relation to the ecliptic.</p></li>
    <li><p>Made every other planet orbit backwards.</p></li>
    <li><p>Tilted Uranus by 97 degrees and Earth by 23.5 degrees (roughly their real-life tilts).</p></li>
    <li><p>Shrunk Saturn's "ring".</p></li>
    <li><p>Made Venus rotate backwards (as it does in real life).</p></li>
    <li><p>Adjusted the rotation amounts of the orbits so that each planets orbits at different speeds. Just like real life, the farther planets take longer to orbit.</p></li>
  </ul>
