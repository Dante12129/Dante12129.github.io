<h3>Design</h3>
<p>I decided to replace the sphere from the tutorial with a torus and the hexagons with helices. These helices are not in the normal poly modeling menu; I discovered them by looking through Maya's Python documentation, and found that I could create helices. The orbit of the helices around the center features a bit of anticipation as they initally rotate slightly counter-clockwise before changing direction to rotate mainly clockwise. As the helices move in and out, they also compress and stretch. While the tutorial used linear tangents, I changed my tangents for the rotation of the helices to be spline tangents. The script generates a camera, point light, and direcitonal light for the scene in addtion to creating and assigning the textures.</p>

<h3>Other Comments</h3>
<p>Rendered with Maya's Software Renderer.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to make the helices spin around their y-axis like screws, but coudln't get this to work at the same time as the aim constraint.</p>
<p>The rotation of the helices was originally done by rotating the helices directly but this stopped working after adding the locators for the inward/outward movement, so I changed it so that the locators were rotated. This gave me the desired result of making the helices orbit the torus.</p>
